#Notes
#rstrip(): This method removes only the trailing whitespace (including spaces, tabs, and line breaks) from the right end of the string. It doesn't affect the leading whitespace or characters in the middle of the string.
#strip(): This method removes both leading and trailing whi√ütespace from the string. It removes spaces, tabs, and line breaks from both ends of the string.
#splitlines() method is used to split the text into lines, and then join() is used to combine the lines back together with newlines, effectively removing any trailing whitespace, including line breaks.
# print("hello, ",'\n' .join(line))
